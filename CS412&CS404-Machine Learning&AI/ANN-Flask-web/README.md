I have completed this project for my internship R&D project warmup.

I created a website using python and flask.

Basicly, this website is just a single page and have a form.
This form consists of some informations about your life situation like current salary , age, debt etc. 
After submitting your form, deep algorithm tells you the optimal car price you can pay.
I used ANN with 2 hidden layers with both 20 neurons for deep learning part.
