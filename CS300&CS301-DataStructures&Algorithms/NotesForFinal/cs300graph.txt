if the pair of vertices in an edge is ordered --- directed graph(digraph)
a cycle in a directed graph is a path of length at least 1 such that w1 = wn
a cycle in an undirected graph has all edges distinct

undirected graph path from ecery to every - connected
directed one --- strongly connected

degree of vertex ---- number of edges
in degree of vertex --- number of edges that comes
out degree of vertex --- number of edges that goes

for directed graphs there can be at most ---- V * V-1 edges
if D is close to 1 then E = O(V^2) -- dense
if D is small E= O(V) -- sparse


total memory for adjacency list representation is------ O(V+E) linear

topological sort is an ordering of vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) -- O(V^2) if graph is dense
--- O(V+E) if graph is sparse







We define the DENSİTY of a graph G as D=|E| / M, where M is the maximum number of possible edges in G.
For UNDİRECTED GRAPHS, there can be at most M=|V|(|V|-1)/2 edges.
For DİAGRAPHS there can be at most M=|V|(|V|-1) edges.
If D is close to 1, that is,|E| = O(|V|2) then the graph is dense.
If D is  small, that is |E| = O(|V|), then the graph is sparse.
The adjacency matrix representation uses O(|V|2) space.
You can easily check if an edge exists or not in O(1) time.
Total memory for adjacency lists is O(|E|)
Total memory for array of pointers is O(|V|)
Total memory for adjacency list representation is  O(|V|+|E|) which is linear in the size of the graph.
TOPOLOGY SORT
This function takes O(|V|) time. Since there are |V| calls, total time is O(|V|2) 0 İNDEGREE VERTİCLES
(O(|V|+|E|) if indegrees are computed) TOTAL TİME
SHORTEST PATH
The cost of a path v1,v2,v3,...,vN is TOPLAM İŞARETİ     this is called as the weighted path length
