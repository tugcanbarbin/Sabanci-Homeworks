1-) Differences between RCA and CLA in terms of synthesis and implementation is smaller than the previous lab.
CLA
27,949 ns
LUTs 47

RCA
28,977ns
LUTs 40
2-)
RCA is better in terms of size with 40 to 47
3-) 
CLA is better in terms of time with 27,949 ns to 28,977
4-)
For RCA, 28.977 * 40 = 1159,08
for CLA, 27.949 * 47 = 1313,603
for both measure, smaller is better. So, the new metric that we created is better if smaller.
So, RCA is better.
